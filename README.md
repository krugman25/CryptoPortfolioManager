# Crypto Portfolio Manager

### Purpose
This crypto portfolio manager workbook is built to allow users to model their crypto portfolio to help them understand what their portfolio's risk, direction leverage and correlation is to a benchmark crypto asset of their choice.  The workbook allows users to model individual strategies within their portfolio to also see these portfolio metrics broken down at a strategy level.

### Adding Symbols
Any crypto symbol can be added to the **Symbols_Data** tab.

### Updating Portfolio
Click the **Process** button on the **Symbols_Data** tab to process data.
This will retrieve the latest data from cryptocompare.com and update the portfolio metrics.

### Updating Models
Currently the symbol data on the **Portfolio** tab must be manually mapped to the symbol data in the **Symbols** tab.
